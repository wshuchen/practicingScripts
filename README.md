Some scripts for projects

_summarizeFeatures.py_ and _getFeatureBed.R_ are for tab-delimited data (data frame or CSV) generated with [GAinSAW](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/GAinSAW) package. The Python script summarizes the count and percentage of lifted and unlifted points according to feature types; the R script turns a data frame into a simplified BED file with all entries or a selected feature type. 

_xgetChainGenomeCoverage_ and _xgetOverlapChainBlock_ are two shell scripts with functions of what the names say for UCSC chain file.
